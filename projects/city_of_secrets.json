His talents didn't go unnoticed, and it wasn't long before Miskatonic University offered him a scholarship that would lead to his own tenure as a professor within its esteemed halls. His research would eventually led him to discover that the very fabric of the cosmos was not confined to the tidy rules of Euclidean geometry, but was instead a convoluted tapestry of twisted dimensions and non-linear spaces. \nThe certainty he once held in the steadfast laws of conventional logic has crumbled in the face of this realization.  His colleagues at Miskatonic are of no help; but how could they be, when they have not peered behind the veil, as he has?  Alone in this puzzling journey, Dudley finds himself adrift in a sea of uncertainty, where the familiar rules of simple existence have become as malleable as an elastic band in the hands of a mischievous child.

Stanley proved a good influence on the growing child, shaping not only young Benji's craftsmanship, but also the very essence of the man he'd eventually become. When Uncle Stanley inherited the peculiar, run-down house on Bridge Street, Benjamin saw it as a chance to showcase all he had imbibed from his uncle— to prove his worth as a journeyman carpenter and, in a way, pay homage to the one who had been his guiding light in the craft.  \nOnce they began work on the house, it didn't take long for Benjamin to notice the changes in his Uncle Stanley. First his mood deteriorated, then his mind- until, finally, Benjamin could only watch in horror as his Uncle's body erupted into a multitude of crawling, writhing limbs. Benjamin understands that he must summon the courage to return to the house and put an end to what he and his uncle had started. But how can he return, when his uncle - what remains of him - lies there in wait for him?",
