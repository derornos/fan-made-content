    "description": "Venture into the worlds of both L. Frank Baum and H.P. Lovecraft as you attempt to expel the Colour from Earth with the assistance of the wonderous creatures from the Land of Oz. You will need all the help you can get as the Colour rapidly warps the world around it. Is there truly a way to stop the alien corruption? Or is Oz simply ground zero for the doom of Earth? Keep your wits and well-being as you fight to drive the Colour back into space!",

It dawns on you that color is light, and for something that is a color in itself, the distortion of light through a gem is like a weak prism, affecting it in a way.  No earthly prism could be enough to dissolve the Colour, but Oz is hardly an earthly place.  You scour the city for the purest of emeralds and call on assistance from Ozma and Glinda to imbue them with the fairy magic of Oz.  Cautiously, you approach an infected section of city and hold the prism up to the light.  With some careful manipulation, the refracted light begins to sear into the Colour, causing it to recoil like burnt foliage.
