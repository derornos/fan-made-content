    "description": "***Shadow of the Watchers*** is a fan-made Investigator expansion for the Arkham Horror Card Game. The expansion includes Louis Cunningham, a Protector who interrogates and neutralizes enemies; Anne Winters, an Inquisitor who skillfully autopsies mythical creatures; Chad Blackwood, an Outlaw who lurks in the shadows and infiltrates deep into enemy territory; Jean Scarlett, a mystic who shifts between man and wolf, using magic and claws to tear down her enemies; and Olive Scott, a survivor who builds on her failures to create more certain successes. These investigators are exploring new territory outside of traditional role families, or pushing role family traits to their limits.",

He's a master at extracting confessions from criminals in the interrogation room, using both force and cunning. But that's not his true identity. When his official duties are over, he becomes a vigilante, quietly monitoring the social scene in Arkham. Of course, if he crosses paths with a fellow colleague on the street, he might end up back behind bars. Nevertheless, Louis will do whatever it takes to eradicate the malevolent forces that has taken hold in Arkham.",

However, just as a coin has two sides, so do blessings. Olive gradually came to realize that hermisfortune could be her good fortune. Upon reaching adulthood, Olive harnessed this luck, as it seemed to be her only innate talent, and joined the Accombe branch of fading Pinkerton Detective Agency, starting as a rookie detective. Then, one night, in a vivid dream, a gray-haired old man appeared to Olive. He revealed that she was his chosen agent, tasked with confronting the evil that was running rempant in Accombe. The question lingered inher mind: Could this enigmatic old man be the source of all her good fortune? Motivated by curiosity and determination, Olive embraced the role of “proxy” to determine whether her life had been marked by luck or misfortune all along.",
